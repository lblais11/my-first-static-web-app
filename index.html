<h1> Welcome to Lindsay Blais's website!</h1>
<p>This website will teach you all about the things that Lindsay likes. Hopefully you will learn a lot, and maybe even share some of my interests.</p>
<h2>Water Skiing</h2>
<p>The first person to ever water ski was Ralph Samuelson in 1922. Water skiing has since evolved to include many different types of the sport. Some of which are:
<ol>
    <li>Slalom skiing</li>
    <li>Trick skiing</li>
    <li>Show skiing</li>
    <li>Competitive skiing</li>
    <li>Jump skiing</li>
    <li>Barefoot skiing</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>Exploring different parts of the world has always been a passion of mine. There is so much the world has to offer from different cultures, to beautiful nature. Here are some of the top places on my bucket list!</p>

    <h2>German</h2>
<p>German is considered an Indo-European language, and is the official language of Germany, Austria, and one of Switzerland. German uniquely has some of the longest words out of any other. The longest word is <i>Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapit√§n</i>.</p>
<h2>Plants</h2>
<p>I love plants because they can prosper in spite of many things. The processes they use seem so unbelievable, and <b>Jeff Vandermeer</b> agrees: <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/jeff_vandermeer_915693?src=t_plants">When you think about the complexity of our natural world - plants using quantum mechanics for photosynthesis, for example - a smartphone begins to look like a pretty dumb object.</blockquote></p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I have always been able to express myself best through writing. I believe it is relaxing, and helpful to understand and control your own emotions. To read more about the benefits, <a href="https://www.sparringmind.com/benefits-of-writing/">click here</a>.</p>
