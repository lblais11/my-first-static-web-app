<h1> Welcome to Lindsay Blais's website!</h1>
<p>This website will teach you all about the things that Lindsay likes. Hopefully you will learn a lot, and maybe even share some of my interests.</p>

<h2>German</h2>
<p>German is considered an Indo-European language, and is the official language of Germany, Austria, and one of Switzerland. German uniquely has some of the longest words out of any other. The longest word is <i>Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapit√§n</i>. The German language consists of different genders for each noun; Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive. Here is a table showing the different definite articles used for each gender and case. </p>

<h2>Plants</h2>
<p>I love plants because they can prosper in spite of many things. The processes they use seem so unbelievable, and <b>Jeff Vandermeer</b> agrees: <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/jeff_vandermeer_915693?src=t_plants">When you think about the complexity of our natural world - plants using quantum mechanics for photosynthesis, for example - a smartphone begins to look like a pretty dumb object.</blockquote>

<p>I have always been able to express myself best through writing. I believe it is relaxing, and helpful to understand and control your own emotions. To read more about the benefits, <a href="https://www.sparringmind.com/benefits-of-writing/">click here</a>.</p>
